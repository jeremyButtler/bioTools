| Fun01: water
|   - run a Waterman Smith alignment on input sequences
| Input:
|   - qrySTPtr:
|     o pointer to seqST with query sequence 
|       - qrySTPtr->offsetSL; first query base to align
|       - qrySTPtr->endAlnSL; last query base to align
|   - refSTPtr:
|     o pointer to seqST with reference sequence 
|       - refSTPtr->offsetSL; 1st reference base to align
|       - refSTPtr->endAlnSL; last reference base to align
|   - matrixSTPtr:
|     o pointer to dirMatrix to use for the alingment
|   - alnSet:
|     o pointer to alnSet with alignment settings
| Output:
|  - Modifies:
|    o errSC in matrixSTPtr to def_memErr_water for
|      memory errors
|    o allocates memory for dirMatrixSC and scoreArySL
|      if they are to small
|    o updates lenMatrixSL and lenScoreSL if dirMatrixSC
|      or scoreArySL are resized
|    o sets errSC in matrixSTPtr to def_memErr_water if
|      had memory errors
|  - Returns:
|    o score for alignment
