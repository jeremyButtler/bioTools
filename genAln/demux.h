| Fun03: barcodeCoords_demux
|   - find the coordinates of barcodes in a read
| Input:
|   - lenSIPtr:
|     o signed int pointer to get length of returned array
|   - seqSTPtr:
|     o seqSTPtr struct pointer with read to demux
|   - barAryST:
|     o refST_kmerFind struct array with barcodes to demux
|   - barLenSI:
|     o number of barcodes in demux
|   - tblSTPtr:
|     o tblST_kmerFind struct pointer to use
|   - minPercScoreF:
|     o float with minimum percent score to keep a primer
|       mapping or discard
|     o recomend 0.9 (90%) to 0.95 (95%)
|     o do not go lower then 80% (otherwise to many
|       mappings kept)
|   - minScoreSL:
|     o signed long with minimum score to keep a primer
|       mapping or discard
|     o disable by using 0
|   - alnSetPtr:
|     o alnSet struct pointer with alignment settings
| Output:
|   - Modifies:
|     o lenSIPtr
|       - length of the returned array
|       - -1 if had two different barcodes overlapping
|       - -2 for memory errors
|   - Returns:
|     o array with the barcode index, start, end, and
|       score of each barcode
|       * index (n % 4 = 0) is barcode index
|       * index (n % 4 = 1) is the barcode start
|       * index (n % 4 = 2) is the barcode end
|       * index (n % 4 = 3) is the score
|       * ex: [index_1, start_1, end_1, score_1,
|              index_2, start_2 end_2, score_2,
|              index_3, start_3, end_3, score_3,
|              ...
|             ]
|     o for memory errors or no sequences (check lenSI)
