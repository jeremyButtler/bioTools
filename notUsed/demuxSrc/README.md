# Use:

Do not use this, use dorado demux. This was made because I
  demuxed using the wrong kit. The results, as expected
  were poor. It uses primFind, but the multi-barcoding
  splitting is poor.

To use this, copy the demuxScr folder one directory
  up `cd ../; cp -r demuxSrc ..;`, then make it with
  make `cd ../demuxSrc; make -f mkfile.static`.
