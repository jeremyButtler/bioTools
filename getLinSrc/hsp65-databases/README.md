# Use

The databases here allows getLin to do species calling
  using the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* hsp65 gene. It
  does not take into account alternate SNP mutations. For
  that I would have to set up simple lineages that look
  for two SNPs. This is possible in getLin, but I did
  not want to take the time.

# Database

- hsp65-db-simple.tsv has the SNP mutations
- hsp65-db-complex.tsv has the species and holds the SNP
  mutations needed to get each speices

The mutations were from Ringuet Hg Akoua-Koffi C.
