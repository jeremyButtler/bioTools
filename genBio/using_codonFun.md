# Use:

Here to give an idea of how to use the libraries in
  genBio. This file is/will be very long, so leverage the
  table of contents to find what you want.

The codonFun files are for converting sequences to amino
  acids or similar checks related to the codon table.

# codonFun

Codon fun contains a set of functions to convert bases or
  amino acid sequences. It is really a wrapper around
  codonTbl, ntTo2Bit, and revNtTo2Bit.

## single amino acid conversion

The codonToAA_codonFun function takes in three bases
  (signed characters) and returns the matching single
  letter amino acid.

```
signed char *sequenceStr = "atg";
signed char aminoAcid =
   codonToAA_codonFun(
      sequenceStr[0],
      sequenceStr[1],
      sequenceStr[2]
   );
```

The revCodonToAA_codonFun function takes in three bases
  (signed characters) and returns the matching, reverse
  complement single letter amino acid.

```
signed char *sequenceStr = "atg";
signed char reverse_complement_aminoAcid =
   revCodonToAA_codonFun(
      sequenceStr[0],
      sequenceStr[1],
      sequenceStr[2]
   );
```

## sequence translation (to amino acids)

The sequenceToAA_codonFun function translates a sequence.

| Input | Use                                     |
|:------|:----------------------------------------|
|  1st  | c-string with sequence to traslate      |
|  2nd  | c-string to hold translated sequence    |
|  3rd  | position to start translation (index 0) |
|  4th  | position to end translation (index 0)   |

Table: inputs for sequenceToAA_codonFun

Make sure the 2nd input (gets ammino acid sequence) is
  large enough to hold the translated sequence
  (1 + sequence length / 3)

```
signed char *sequenceStr = "atgccctaa";
signed char *aminoAcidStr[16];
signed long lengthAASL = 0;

lengthAASL = 
   seqToAA_codonFun(
      sequenceStr,
      aminoAcidStr,
      0,
      0
   );
```

## misc functions

You can also convert a three letter amino acid to a one
  letter using aaTripToChar_codonFun. This takes a
  c-string and returns the single letter amino acid code
  as a signed char or 0 if the input code was not an
  amino acid.

```
signed char *threeLetterStr = "Met";
signed char aaSC = aaTripToChar_codonFun(threeLetterStr);

if(! aaSC)
   /*DEAL WITH INVALID CODES*/
```

You can check if the codon is a bacterial start codon
  with codon with bactStart_codonFun, or for reverse
  complement bactRevStart_codonFun. The input is three
  base and the output is bacterial 1 if is a start codon
  or 0 if not.

```
signed char *seqStr = "atg";

if(bactStart_codonFun(seqStr[0], seqStr[1], seqStr[2]))
   /*have start codon*/
else
   /*not a start codon*/

if(bactRevStart_codonFun(seqStr[0], seqStr[1], seqStr[2]))
   /*have reversee complement start codon*/
else
   /*not a reverese complement start codon*/
```
