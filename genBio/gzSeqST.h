| Fun01: get_gzSeqST
|   - gets a sequence from a fastx/fastx.gz file
| Input:
|   - fileSTPtr:
|     o file_inflate struct to use in uncompression
|   - typeSCPtr:
|     o is set to or has the correct file type
|   - seqSTPtr:
|     o seqST struct pointer to add new sequence to
|   - inFILE:
|     o FILE pointer to file to add (new file)
|     o 0 if already called get_gzSeqST for this file
|     o you should set inFILE to 0/null after calling,
|       because freeStack_file_inflate 
|       freeHeap_file_inflate will close inFILE for you
| Output:
|   - Modifies:
|     o if have inFILE, sets fileSTPtr be blanked and then
|       have inFILE
|     o if have inFILE, typeSCPtr to have file type 
|       o def_noType_gzSeqST if end of file
|       o def_faType_gzSeqST if fasta file
|       o def_faType_gzSeqST | def_gzType_gzSeqST if
|         fasta.gz file
|       o def_fqType_gzSeqST if fastq file
|       o def_fqType_gzSeqST | def_gzType_gzSeqST if
|         fastq.gz file
|     o fileSTPtr to be on next read/sequence
|     o seqSTPtr to have next read/sequence
|   - Returns:
|     o 0 for no errors
|     o def_EOF_seqST if at end of file
|     o def_memErr_seqST for memory errors
|     o def_badLine_seqST | def_fileErr_seqST for invalid
|       file entries
|     o def_fileErr_seqST for file errors (including gzip
|       checks)
